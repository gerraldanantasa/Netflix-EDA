# Netflix Content Strategy Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the content strategy of Netflix using a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA). By examining key trends in Netflix's movie and TV show library, this analysis provides valuable insights into genre preferences, top producing countries, changes in title counts over time, and the distribution of movies versus TV shows. The goal is to understand Netflix's content evolution and its strategic focus areas across global markets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is from Kaggle: [Netflix Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). It contains detailed information about the titles available on Netflix, including:

- **Title**: The name of the movie or TV show.
- **Genre**: The genre of the title.
- **Country**: The country of origin for the title.
- **Rating**: The content rating of the title (e.g., TV-MA, TV-14, PG).
- **Release Year**: The year the title was released.
- **Content Type**: Whether the title is a movie or a TV show.

## Methodology

The analysis employs several key metrics to understand Netflix’s content landscape:

- **Genre Distribution**: The frequency of each genre is analyzed to identify the most prevalent genres in Netflix's catalog.
- **Country of Origin**: The number of titles originating from each country is analyzed to identify the top producing countries.
- **Title Count Over Time**: The number of titles added to Netflix over time is tracked to identify trends and significant changes in content volume.
- **Movie vs. TV Show Distribution**: The overall proportion of movies and TV shows in the Netflix library is analyzed.
- **Rating Distribution**: The distribution of ratings across Netflix titles is explored, including how different content types (Movies vs. TV Shows) compare.

## Key Insights

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are a few key recommendations for Netflix:

1. **Diversify Genres**: While **International Movies** and **Dramas** are dominant, Netflix should consider exploring niche genres to attract a wider range of viewers.

3. **Increase TV Show Production**: Given the growing demand for serialized content, Netflix should focus on increasing the proportion of **high-quality TV series**.
4. **Content Balance**: While **Movies** dominate, introducing more **family-friendly content** could help broaden Netflix’s appeal, especially in markets with younger audiences.

## Conclusion
